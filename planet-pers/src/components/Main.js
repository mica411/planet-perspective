            <h1>Statistics</h1>
            <ul><h3>Global Temperature Rise:</h3>
            
            <li>The Earth's average temperature has risen by about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 19th century.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</h3>
            
            <li>Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere surpassed 415 parts per million (ppm) in 2021, a level not seen in millions of years.</li>
            <li>The largest sources of global greenhouse gas emissions include the burning of fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and industrial processes.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Sea Level Rise:</h3>
            
            <li>Global sea levels have risen by about 8 inches (20 cm) over the past century.</li>
            <li>Melting ice caps and glaciers contribute to rising sea levels.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Extreme Weather Events:</h3>
            
            <li>There is an observed increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Arctic Ice Melt:</h3>
            
            <li>Arctic sea ice extent has been decreasing, with the Arctic warming at more than twice the global average rate.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Loss of Biodiversity:</h3>
            
            <li>Climate change contributes to habitat loss and alteration, impacting ecosystems and leading to the loss of biodiversity.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Ocean Acidification:</h3>
            
            <li>The oceans absorb about 30% of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, leading to ocean acidification, which can harm marine life, particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Renewable Energy Adoption:</h3>
            
            <li>The use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, has been increasing, but fossil fuels still dominate the global energy mix.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>International Agreements:</h3>
            
            <li>The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</li></ul>
            
            <p>It's essential to note that ongoing research and monitoring provide more detailed and updated information. Governments, scientists, and organizations around the world continue to work on mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change. For the latest information, refer to reputable sources like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and other climate research institutions</p>

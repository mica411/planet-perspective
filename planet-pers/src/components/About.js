                <p>Climate change is an urgent global crisis that requires universal awareness.
                     The most apparent issue of which is rising greenhouse gases result in unprecedented
                      temperature increases, extreme weather events, and rising sea levels to name a few. 
                      Whether we realize it or not, we are contributing to climate change as well through practices
                       like overuse of single-use plastics and even forgetting switch of lights in the house. We are 
                       all passionate about spreading awareness of this topic as we believe our actions today directly 
                       affect our future.</p>

                <p>Many people are realizing that global warming is a huge issue, but most people are unaware 
                    of how their various actions contribute to the increase in global warming. Many people want to
                     improve the situation but do not know how to get started and are also unaware of many other unusual
                      solutions that can also better the conditions. So, our website provides awareness about the global 
                      warming / climate change issue in a heavily-interactive way through hands-on activities and 
                      practices that users can use to understand the issue and also actively fight climate change by 
                      inculcating our solutions in their life, real time.</p>

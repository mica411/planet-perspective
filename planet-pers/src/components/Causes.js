            <h1>Causes & Effects</h1>
            <h2>Causes of Climate Change:</h2>
            
            <ul><h3>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</h3>
            
            <li>The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy is a major contributor to the increase in greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), in the atmosphere.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Deforestation:</h3>
            
            <li>The clearing of forests for agriculture, logging, and other purposes reduces the number of trees that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Industrial Processes:</h3>
            
            <li>Certain industrial activities release greenhouse gases, such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), into the atmosphere.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Agricultural Practices:</h3>
            
            <li>Agricultural activities, including livestock farming and rice cultivation, produce methane. The use of synthetic fertilizers also releases nitrous oxide.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Waste Management:</h3>
            
            <li>Landfills and waste treatment processes can produce methane emissions.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Land Use Changes:</h3>
            
            <li>Alterations in land use, such as urbanization and changes in land cover, can impact local and regional climates.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Transportation:</h3>
            
            <li>The combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles and transportation systems contributes to CO2 emissions.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Industrial Revolution:</h3>
            
            <li>The rapid increase in industrial activities during the 18th and 19th centuries marked a significant period of human-induced climate change.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Effects of Climate Change:</h2>
            
            <ul><h3>Rising Temperatures: </h3>
            
            <li>Average global temperatures are increasing, leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels:</h3>
            
            <li>Ice caps and glaciers are melting, contributing to rising sea levels and threatening coastal areas.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Extreme Weather Events:</h3>
            
            <li>Increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including hurricanes, droughts, floods, and wildfires.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Ocean Acidification:</h3>
            
            <li>The absorption of excess CO2 by the oceans leads to acidification, harming marine life, particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Changes in Precipitation Patterns:</h3>
            
            <li>Altered patterns of rainfall and snowfall, leading to more intense storms or longer periods of drought.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Shifts in Ecosystems:</h3>
            
            <li>Changes in temperature and precipitation can disrupt ecosystems, affecting plant and animal species and their habitats.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Loss of Biodiversity:</h3>
            
            <li>Climate change poses a threat to various species and ecosystems, leading to shifts in biodiversity and potential extinctions.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Impacts on Agriculture:</h3>
            
            <li>Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can affect crop yields and food production, leading to food insecurity.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Health Risks:</h3>
            
            <li>Climate change can exacerbate health issues, including the spread of diseases, heat-related illnesses, and challenges in accessing clean water.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Social and Economic Disruptions:</h3>
            
            <li>Climate-related events can lead to displacement, migration, and economic challenges, particularly in vulnerable communities.</li>
            </ul>
